# An Investigation into Topology in the Quantum Hall Effect and Non-Abelian Anyons

This project explores the topological structure underlying the **Quantum Hall Effect (QHE)** and its connection to **non-Abelian anyons** — quasiparticles with exotic braiding statistics relevant for **topological quantum computation**.

## Overview

The study investigates:
- The role of **Berry curvature** and **Chern numbers** in quantized Hall conductance.  
- The structure of **Landau levels** in magnetic fields and their topological interpretation.  
- **Fractional Quantum Hall states** described by Laughlin, Moore–Read, and Read–Rezayi wavefunctions.  
- The emergence of **non-Abelian anyons** (Ising and Fibonacci) and their relation to **Chern–Simons** and **conformal field theory** descriptions.

## Methods

Analytical derivations and literature-based theoretical analysis were performed to:
- Connect quantum Hall topology to Chern–Simons field theory.  
- Understand the role of quasiparticle statistics in fault-tolerant quantum computation.  
- Examine model Hamiltonians for fractional Hall states and their edge modes.
